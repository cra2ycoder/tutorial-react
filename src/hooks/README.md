# Hooks

- New addition from `16.8` react release
- helps us to use `state` and other react `features` **without using `class`**

- **Completely opt-in**

  - you can try using with existing components that you have

- **100% backwards-compatible**

  - NO BREAKING Changes in Hooks

- **No plans to remove class components**

  - Hooks is just additional features for React, so existing features will not be deprecated

- **Hooks provides direct API**

  - you may already familier with: `props, state, context, ref and lifecycle.`
  - Hooks just provide you alternate powerful way to work on the same features.

- **Update your all packages when updating react**
  - while updating `react` update the `reactDOM` when you trying to get the updates for hooks

## Why Hooks?

- **Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy**
- **Helps to split one component into multiple small functions and handles lifecycle easily**
- **Hooks let you use more of React's features without classes**

- **render:**
  - as the hooks are functional components means just like functions, so no render() will be required

## Core pieces

- **State Hook:** (state management)

  - `this.state + this.setState => useState()`

- **Effect Hook** (life cycle)

  - `componentDidMount + componentDidUpdate + componentWillUnmount` => `useEffect()`
  - `componentDidCatch + getDerivedStateFromError` => there are no hooks methods yet but will be added soon.

- **Custom Hooks** (build our own hooks)
- **Other Hooks** (using context with hooks)

## ESLint support for Hooks

- add the following package in your `devDependencies`

```json
devDependencies: {
    "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "1.6.0"
}
```

- and run the following command to install

```
yarn install
```

- add configuration in `.eslintrc.json`

```json
{
  "plugins": ["react-hooks"],
  "rules": {
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error",
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn"
  }
}
```

## Rules of Hooks

- Don't call Hooks **inside loops, conditions, or nested functions**
  - instead always use at the top level in the react function components
- Add ESLint plugin for hooks lints `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (see above)
- Hooks are called based on the order which declared in the code flow
- DON'T make any conditions on the hooks function instead use inside of it

  - wrong

  ```jsx
  // üî¥ We're breaking the first rule by using a Hook in a condition
  if (name !== '') {
    useEffect(function persistForm() {
      localStorage.setItem('formData', name)
    })
  }
  ```

  - correct

  ```jsx
  useEffect(function persistForm() {
    // üëç We're not breaking the first rule anymore
    if (name !== '') {
      localStorage.setItem('formData', name)
    }
  })
  ```
